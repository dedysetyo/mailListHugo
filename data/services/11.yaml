speech: "<p>Mail-List.com offers a wonderful service. I admit I was intimidated with the thought of moderating an online discussion group, as I am sorely lacking in computer skills. Mail-List.com has been beyond reproach. Set-up was a breeze, maintenance is almost non-existent, and our group has thrived!</p><p>The few times I have needed technical assistance (	 the fault of a 'free mail service') they have immediately come to my rescue, and seen the problem through to resolution. Your backup cannot be beat! Having been a visitor to many other online discussion groups, I believe our format to be far superior. I love the continuity - without EVER a pop-up or advertisement. The annual fee for our mail list is such a fair one, I cannot understand why other groups tolerate the irritations associated with 'free' services!</p><p>The Excess Iron Discussion Group now has more than 200 members representing 7 nations around the world. The Internet offers us such empowerment - our discussion group has been an overwhelming success!</p><p>Thank you so much for the wonderful opportunity you afford to us, and for the wonderful job you do. You are very much appreciated; I would without reservation recommend Mail-List.com to anyone!</p>"
