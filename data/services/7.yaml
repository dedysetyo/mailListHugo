speech: "<p>I really had no experience with managing a list so I needed to have a real simple approach and support. <span class='bold_text'>The interface that the managers and the subscribers use is dirt simple, but behind it there is all the power you need.</span> That is sort of the ideal in technology. It’s the power that you need. And then of course with them always being available immediately for support.</p><p>They will tell me things that I am not aware of, and say hey this is going on with the list, it looks like your users are moving in this direction. I am adding this new capability to the list are you interested in it, would you like to try it out. With them sort of watching and seeing how it is working behind the scenes it allows for the list to grow just as it would on its own. It’s real sort of organic the way that it happens. They sort of watch that from behind the scenes and it keeps sort of nudging and improving the technology to meet the needs that we may not even know we have.</p><p>So very infrequently I do have to step in and sort of be the diplomat. When people have questions about the list I pretty much always tell them that it’s a self governing list. There are some policies, very broad policies that NACNS has put together over the years. It really does have a sense of community of practice. It is very remarkable that way.</p>"
