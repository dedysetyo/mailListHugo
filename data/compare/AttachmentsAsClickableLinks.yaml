Those members that want that particular attachment, simply click on the link to download the file.</p><p>The short plain text email does not trigger alarms like big files do. And your members do not waste bandwidth on files they did not want anyway.</p><p><a href='https://www.mail-list.com/clickable-attachments/' target='_blank'>Learn more</a></p>"
