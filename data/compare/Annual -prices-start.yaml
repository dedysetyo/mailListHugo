However, you do pay in other ways.</p><p>Their impediments all result in friction, which slows down the communications in your group. Whether it is members that will not get a Google or Yahoo account, or people that accidentally ignore your invitation, or those that donâ€™t want their messages searchable by the search engines, or slow and inconsistent delivery that drags conversations out, or a technical snafu that never gets resolved, your group pays a price.</p><p>Your group has an abundance of knowledge and wisdom, and a few pennies per user per month to help share it, is the best investment you can make.</p><p>Mail-List.com charges by the size of your group, and you can send as many messages as you want.</p>"
