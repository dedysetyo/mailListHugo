The ads tend to be ugly and distracting, and some of your subscribers may even think your organization is endorsing the products being advertised</p><p>Mail-List.com does not insert any ads into your messages. In fact, it snips ads sent in by your subscribers at AOL and Hotmail when they post a message.</p><p>So your members can enjoy their conversations without distracting commercials.</p>"
