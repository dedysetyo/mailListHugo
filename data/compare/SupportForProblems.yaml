Neither company has an official help desk where you submit a problem and expect to have it solved.</p><p>Mail-List.com has a help desk staffed with real people that will solve your problem within one hour during normal business hours.</p><p>So you can turn any problems over to Mail-List.com and get back to your real job.</p>"
