## Grow Your List For Free During The Year

We invoice once a year, so if you add members during the year, there is no additional charge. And if people leave your group, we do not give a refund. Then a year later, we will count up your current subscribers and send you an updated invoice for another year of service.

## No extra charge for bandwidth!

Unlike other mailing list hosting companies, Mail-List.com does NOT charge extra for bandwidth. That means you don’t have to worry about how many messages you send, or having large attachments in your emails. One flat price per subscriber, regardless of how much you use our service.

## What Happens Next?

After you complete the setup process (6 questions to answer), please respond to our email and tell us a bit more about how we can help you. We will then send you the Quickstart Manual with your password.

Your list will be placed in the Enterprise Group for the first 30 days, and you will enjoy quick delivery of your emails and full support via telephone or email. You can add phone numbers to send SMS Text messages, and you can use the Searchable Web Archives and your own domain name.

You can start adding subscribers directly to your mailing list, and start the customization process. For instance, you will probably want to allow attachments, and change the physical address on the bottom of each email to your own. You can learn how to customize and run your list by watching our [videos](/videos/).

If you like our service, we will send you an invoice after your 30 day trial is over. You can decide at that time which level of service you want, Personal, Professional or Enterprise.
