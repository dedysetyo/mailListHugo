# Do you need some feedback and direction from your subscribers from time to time?

A quick, easy to prepare, easy to use survey is just the ticket to getting that feedback.  You don't have to set up a survey, you just ask the question in your email.  You can even ask your question in the Subject line.

And your subscribers know they don't have to answer 1,000 different questions, because there is just one question.  Each subscriber is allowed to vote one time, and may add comments if they choose. The voting itself is anonymous.

## Create your survey in any email, by using the special phrase - survey-link-here

## The special phrase - survey-link-here - will be replaced in each subscriber's email with a unique link.

## The web page looks the same no matter what your survey question is.
